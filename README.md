# MikroTik-NPK-Archive

## Why this repo
- After the Margin Research findings were published about MikroTik routers, the company removed all download links to their older firmware. The only versions available for download are those that are not vulnerable to the Margin Research exploit. Historically, MikroTik has been very unfriendly to security researchers and jailbreaks of their routers. They go to great lengths to ensure little is known about how these devices actually function. Most of the public information regarding MikroTik internals come from security researches like Margin Research, and Jacob Baines https://github.com/jacob-baines.

## Inspiration 
- As a researcher myself, I often want to download an older firmware image to flash onto a device, however finding older .npk files is increasingly difficult as the years progress. A Reddit user smileymattj realized that MikroTik didnt actually remove the old .npk files from their website, they simply removed the download link to them .
